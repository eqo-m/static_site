Hi, i'm Elko and i have been working with *** for almost two months now.
First of all, i'd like to thank you for providing a really interesting work experience.
And also for the opportunity to apply for an internal team role.

So about me, i listed my  relevant skills in the application, which would mainly be data analysis and
proficiency with statiscal evaluation of datasets. 
Which i think would make me an asset in a data analysis role.

But here, as asked i would like to focus on why this is an exciting opportunity for me.
I have been interested in machine learning and AI since i first encountered it as  "statistical learning" ..
In fact i was debating with myself whether to study physics or computer science and i very narrowly
decided on physics - i think had i known how exciting the field would become in the following years, i would 
have decided differently.
Now i'm currently acquiring certifications in the field and hope my existing data analysis and programming
knowledge can be a good foundation.

I have also been a Tutor for maths and physics and there are some similiraties but also some very stark differences 
when dealing with LLM output vs.  human learners.

When analysing LLM output, you start to recognize patterns, like here it didn't check the premises,
here it must have got lost solving a subproblem, this seems attention related and so on.
So this part is very interesting to me and i would like to learn how one can use finer classification of such problems
and whether and how one can quantify them and target them specifically.

During my tasks i tried not to overdo it, because i didn't want to introduce some pessimistic snooping bias but i would love to see
more of this apect in -depth. For much the same reason i didn't look into annotation metrics yet, but if you see a skill and personality match
i would work hard to deepen my knowledge in these areas so that i can apply it in data analysis or project design.

So, thank you for your time and i hope i'll be hearing from you.
